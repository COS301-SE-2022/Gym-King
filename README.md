I am currently studying BSc Information and Knowledge Systems at the University of Pretoria. I was drawn to the field of Information Technology because of how dynamic it is. Whilst there have been times where I felt a little lost when learning new programming languages and concepts, I love a good challenge and learning more about something I enjoy. 
I believe that the University of Pretoria gives its students a wonderful opportunity to be able to have a small taste of the industry before we dive in headfirst once we graduate, and I look forward to hopefully working with you and your company on this exciting project.<br> <br>

I am a BSC-CS student at the University of Pretoria. I was drawn to IT at a young age when my uncle gave me an Arduino, ever since then, I knew I wanted to become a programmer. It is now one of my greatest passions. One of my biggest weaknesses is finding motivation/energy to accomplish tasks/activities that I deem unimportant. On the other hand, when it comes to things I am interested in, such as one of my passions, I develop a borderline obsessive-compulsive desire to excel in the activity. I think this Project could be one of those activities for me and that is why I am so excited to get started. I have a brief background in AR app development as I've completed a few team projects over at bizAR (bizarreality.co.za). <br> <br>

I am studying BSc Information and Knowledge Systems with software development as my elective group. I enjoy working on user interfaces and my goal is to one day start working in software, app or web development as a frontend developer and designer. I am very disciplined and organised and love learning new programming languages and exploring new technologies. It takes me a bit longer to grasp back-end concepts, but I work very hard to understand them. I am excited to work on this project and learn more about the software development industry. <br> <br>

I am Ryan Broemer, currently studying at the University of Pretoria. I am studying BSc Information and Knowledge Systems. I have a huge interest in anything related to data science as that is where I would like to find myself one day. I am good with learning new languages and really enjoy data management. I also like database related problems. Sometimes I run into thought issues. I cannot make certain next step decisions myself. Usually wait for my next task or job from our group leader. I believe I can put the knowledge I have learned to the test by hopefully working with you and my team to create an amazing product. <br> <br>

A student at the University of Pretoria, currently studying for a BSc in Computer Science. I am born South African, hailed from Benoni. I am a creative thinker and a disciplined student, who takes pride in his work with great attention to detail. I can implement good front-end practices and often showcase my profound interest in machine learning and statistics. I might not be too familiar with some of the technologies out there, but I am more than willing to learn and work on my ever-growing knowledge, as this will only help me on my path to becoming a good computer scientist. <br> <br>
